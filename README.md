# PacketSniffer.py

## Overview
`PacketSniffer.py` is a Python script designed to capture and analyze network packets passing through the network interface on which it is running. This tool can help network administrators, security analysts, and cybersecurity professionals monitor network traffic, detect anomalies, and ensure network security.

## Features
- Capture live packet data from specified network interfaces.
- Filter packets based on protocol types (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- Log packet details, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and payload data.
- Provide real-time analysis and statistics of network traffic.
- Detect common network threats and anomalies.
- Save captured packet data for offline analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scapy: A powerful Python-based tool for network packet manipulation and sniffing.
- Pcapy: A Python extension module for capturing network traffic.

## Installation
To use `PacketSniffer.py`, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Then, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install scapy
pip install pcapy
```

## Usage
To start packet capturing, run the script with Python 3. You may need administrative or root privileges to capture packets:

```bash
sudo python3 PacketSniffer.py
```

### Optional Arguments
You can customize the script's behavior using the following command-line arguments:

- `-i / --interface`: Specify the network interface to capture packets from (e.g., eth0, wlan0).
- `-p / --protocol`: Filter captured packets by a specific protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- `-o / --output`: Define a file to save the captured packet logs.
- `-v / --verbose`: Enable verbose mode for detailed packet information.

Example command:

```bash
sudo python3 PacketSniffer.py -i eth0 -p TCP -o captured_packets.log
```
